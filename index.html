    <h1> Geog 370 - Homework 3: Map Projections. September 7, 2022 </h1>
    <h1> Projection #1: WGS 84 </h1>
        <img src="./pngs/WGS84EPSG43266.png" width="1000 px">
        <h3> The WGS84 Projection is the starting point in QGIS and the shape of the countries retain recognizability. 
    </h3>
    <h1> Projection #2: Pseudo-Mercator</h1>
        <img src="./pngs/Pseudo-Mercator.png" width="1000px">
        <h3>The Mercator Projection is special in that it retains direction, which is useful for navigators. ALthough the Mercator may not always direct the travelor to a route in the shortest distance, it may be used to accurately measure direction.
    </h3>
    <h1> Projection #3: Aitoff</h1>
        <img src="./pngs/WorldAitoff54043.png" width="1000px">
        <h3>The Aitoff is a modified azimuthal projection of the world that optimizes presentation. 
    </h3>
    <h1>Projection #4: Sphere-Winkel 1</h1>
        <img src="./pngs/Sphere Winkel 1.png" width="1000px">
        <h3>This projection is pseudocylindrical and used to present with only moderate distortion in most areas.
    </h3>
    <h1>Projection #5: World Equal Area</h1>
      <h3><img src="./pngs/World Equal Area.png" width="1000px">
        This cylindrical map is a good thematic map often used for presentation.
    </h3>
    <h1>Projection #6: World Equidistant Conic</h1>
        <img src="./pngs/WorldEquiConic.png" width="1000px">
        <h3>This projection does well because distance is close to equal in each direction.
    </h3>
    <h1>Projection #7: North Pole Azimuthal Equidistant</h1>
    <h3> 
        <img src="./pngs/NorthPoleAzimuthal Equidistant.png" width="1000 px">
        This projection also is equidistant and optimizes topographic features, navigation, and national agencies.
     </h3>
     <h1>Projection #8: World Eckert VI </h1>
     <img src="./pngs/World Eckert VI.png" width="1000px">
     <h3> This projection is pseudocylindrical and is a very good thematic map
     </h3>
     <h1> Projection #9:Sphere Loximuthal</h1>
     <img src="./pngs/Sphere Loximuthal.png" width="1000px">
     <h3> The Sphere Loximuthal Projection is good for navigation. 
     </h3>
     <h1> Projection #10: World Plate Carree
        <img src="./pngs/World Plate Carree.png" width="1000 px"> </h1>
     <h3>This cylindrical projection is one of the weaker projections for balancing preservation of distance, direction, shape, and area. However, it still remains recognizable.
    </h3>
